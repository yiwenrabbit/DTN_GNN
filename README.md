## DTN_GNN: A Digital Twin Network and Graph Neural Network-Based Edge Computing System

### Project Overview

DTN_GNN combines Digital Twin Network (DTN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) technologies to build an intelligent edge
computing decision-making system. The system mainly addresses the computation task allocation problem in vehicular
networks by utilizing GNN and reinforcement learning technologies to achieve efficient computation resource scheduling.

### Technical Background

* **Digital Twin Network (DTN)**

Digital twins are virtual representations of physical entities in the digital world. In this project, DTN is used to
simulate and predict the behavior of vehicular networks, providing an accurate environmental model for decision-making.

* **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**

GNN is a deep learning model specialized in processing graph-structured data. It processes network topology information,
learns the complex relationships between nodes, and supports resource allocation decisions.

* **Edge Computing**
  Edge computing moves computational resources from centralized clouds to the network edge, reducing latency and
  improving efficiency. This project simulates the task offloading decision-making process between edge servers and
  vehicles.
